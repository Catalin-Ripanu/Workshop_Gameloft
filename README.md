# Workshop_Gameloft

Created a Client-Server application which implements the Ping-Pong mechanism.

The goal of this project was to benchmark the network latency when running the Client on localhost vs running it on a remote machine located in SUA (used AWS to obtain a Virtual Machine to be able to do this).

This workshop was organised by Gameloft staff, along with POLYTECHNIC University of Bucharest during 3DPUB Summer School [1].
